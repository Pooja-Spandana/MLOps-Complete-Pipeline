Building Pipeline:
1> Create a GitHub repo and clone it in local (Add experiments).
2> Add src folder along with all components(run them individually).
3> Add data, models, reports directories to .gitignore file
4> Now git add, commit, push

Setting up DVC pipeline (without params)
5> Create dvc.ymal file & add stages to it.
6> dvc init, then do dvc repro to test the pipeline automation.
    check dvc dag -> directed acyclic graph, it shows the flow in which each component is connected to each other
7> now git add, commit, push.
